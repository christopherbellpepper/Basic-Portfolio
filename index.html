        <p>
          I love computers, design, creation, and challenges: I have experience
          with web development languages/libraries like JavaScript, CSS, HTML,
          jQuery, Bootstrap, Node.js, Express, MySQL, MongoDB, Handlebars,
          Sequelize and integrating APIs, as well as advanced training with
          design software like the Adobe Creative Cloud.
        </p>

        <p>
          Additionally, I'm an experienced and enthusiastic Team Manager looking
          for the next great opportunity to help grow a business both
          financially and culturally. A longstanding and proven track record in
          sales, customer service and employee recruitment/development headline
          a vast skill set. Seeking to build long term relationships that
          represent sustainable business.

        <!-- <p>I am an abstract artist, a concrete analyst, and a ruthless bookie. Critics worldwide swoon over my original line of corduroy evening wear. I don't perspire. I am a private citizen, yet I receive fan mail. I have been caller number nine and have won the weekend passes. Last summer I toured New Jersey with a traveling centrifugal-force demonstration. I bat .400. My deft floral arrangements have earned me fame in international botany circles. Children trust me.</p> -->

        <!-- <p>I can hurl tennis rackets at small moving objects with deadly accuracy. I once read Paradise Lost, Moby Dick, and David Copperfield in one day and still had time to refurbish an entire dining room that evening. I know the exact location of every food item in the supermarket. I have performed several covert operations for the CIA. I sleep once a week; when I do sleep, I sleep in a chair. The laws of physics do not apply to me.</p> -->

        <!-- <p>I balance, I weave, I dodge, I frolic, and my bills are all paid. On weekends, to let off steam, I participate in full-contact origami. Years ago I discovered the meaning of life but forgot to write it down. I have made extraordinary four course meals using only a mouli and a toaster oven. I breed prizewinning clams. I have won bullfights in San Juan.  I have performed open-heart surgery, and I have spoken with Elvis. </p> -->
